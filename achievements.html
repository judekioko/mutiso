        <h2>Our Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            We have managed to increase the number of classrooms, dormitories, and laboratories to <strong>81</strong>. This includes projects such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ielanthi and Wamboo Secondary School dormitory</li>
            <li>Masinga Boys Laboratory</li>
            <li>Many others improving student access to facilities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Bursary Allocation:</strong> We have ensured bursary distribution to needy students in both secondary and tertiary institutions. This has contributed to improved transition from primary to secondary and to tertiary institutions, making education more affordable.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Security Projects:</strong> We have improved security by setting up projects such as <em>Kikumini police post</em> to enhance safety for our personnel and residents.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Environmental Conservation:</strong> We have drilled a borehole at Kanyonga Primary School and installed water tanks in multiple schools to promote water harvesting. Additionally, dustbins have been distributed to schools to prevent pollution.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Youth Empowerment & Sports:</strong> We organize annual constituency tournaments to nurture young talents. More than <strong>10 football clubs</strong> have benefitted from our sports kitty by receiving:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uniforms</li>
            <li>Football boots</li>
            <li>Trophies & Certificates</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Many schools have benefitted from the emergency kitty, which is used to handle unforeseen circumstances within our constituency.
        </p>

        <p class="closing">
            The residents of Masinga Constituency appreciate the progress made possible by the NG-CDF. <br>
